**We did it, all together.** [XCP-ng is now funded at 437%](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/78495858/xcp-ng). Is it the end? No, it's just a start.

## Committed to make it real

We are very pleased to announce that all the original stretch goals have been reached in less than 5 days.

**Thank you everyone for making the XCP-ng project stronger a little bit more every day!**

That's awesome and shows everyone than the best open source virtualization solution is still a thing to be created! And now? There is still 26 days remaining for making this Kickstarter campaign a legendary one! That's the reason why we have added one more stretch goal aiming to assemble a bigger A-team on it.

> The point is to hire more contractors dedicated to XCP-ng, with a broader spectrum of skills (eg. OCaml, XAPI, CentOS expertsâ€¦) This way, XCP-ng should be ready faster as well as offering us more room for improvements.

We are **committed to release it**, and we are working hard for that!
