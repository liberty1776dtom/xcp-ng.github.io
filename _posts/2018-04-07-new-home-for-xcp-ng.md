Say goodbye to GitHub pages, and say hello to the [new XCP-ng community website!](https://xcp-ng.org). We wanted something more clean, easier to contribute for the community (adding more people to write content using a very "common" Wordpress blog).

But it's also the opportunity to create a dedicated [forum](https://xcp-ng.org/forum)! This will be the place for everyone to discuss about XCP-ng, on specific topics and to help each other.

> In a near future, this place will redirect to https://xcp-ng.org. We'll only lose the comments, but we count on your to participage massively on the new forum!

By the way, don't miss the latest blog post on the new site: [next release target for XCP-ng](https://xcp-ng.org/2018/04/07/next-release-target-7-4-1/)!

See you there!
